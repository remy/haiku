In the cicada's cry
No sign can foretell
How soon it must die.

No one travels
Along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

From time to time
The clouds give rest
To the moon-beholders.

Autumn moonlight-
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.

An old silent pond...
A frog jumps into the pond,
splash! Silence again.

Lightning flash-
what I thought were faces
are plumes of pampas grass.

In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus -
A lovely sunset

First winter rain-
even the monkey
seems to want a raincoat.

The shallows-
a crane’s thighs splashed
in cool waves

The summer grasses
All that remains
Of brave soldiers dreams

My life, -
How much more of it remains?
The night is brief.

spring rain:
browsing under an umbrella
at the picture-book store

looking up
what a high pagoda
in the autumn sky

Consider me
As one who loved poetry
And persimmons.

I want to sleep
Swat the flies
Softly, please.

the pear blossoming...
after the battle this
ruined house

Toward those short trees
We saw a hawk descending
On a day in spring.

how much longer
is my life?
a brief night...

green in the field
was pounded into
rice cake

I wonder
a cow has eaten up the leaves
a spider lily

looking down I see,
cool in the moonlight,
4000 houses

a dog howling
sound of footsteps
longer nights

five-tired waterfall -
on each tire there are
red maple leaves

Over the wintry
forest, winds howl in rage
with no leaves to blow.

the sky I see
seems full of
magnolia blossoms

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

Now gathering,
Now scattering,
Fireflies over the river.

On New Year's Day
I long to meet my parents
as they were before my birth.

The crow has flown away:
swaying in the evening sun,
a leafless tree.

when they strike the bell
these gingko leaves are falling -
Temple Kencho-ji

the dark blue
is relaxing at the beginning of autumn -
ikat from Iyo

Early summer rain-
houses facing the river,
two of them

Washing the hoe-
ripples on the water;
far off, wild ducks.

A summer river being crossed
how pleasing
with sandals in my hands!

Straw sandal half sunk
in an old pond
in the sleety snow.

Calligraphy of geese
against the sky-
the moon seals it.

Light of the moon
Moves west, flowers' shadows
Creep eastward.

My arm for a pillow,
I really like myself
under the hazy moon.

Not quite dark yet
and the stars shining
above the withered fields.

In the moonlight,
The colour and scent of the wisteria
Seems far away.

The end of spring--
the poet is brooding
about editors.

Blown from the west,
fallen leaves gather
in the east.

Old well,
a fish leaps-
dark sound.

Don’t weep, insects –
Lovers, stars themselves,
Must part.

Everything I touch
with tenderness, alas,
pricks like a bramble.

What a strange thing!
to be alive
beneath cherry blossoms.

Winter seclusion -
Listening, that evening,
To the rain in the mountain.

In spring rain
a pretty girl
yawning.

O snail
Climb Mount Fuji,
But slowly, slowly!

I'm going out,
flies, so relax,
make love.

Trusting the Buddha, good and bad,
I bid farewell
To the departing year.

Sparrow's child
out of the way, out of the way!
the stallion's coming through

Last time, I think,
I'll brush the flies
from my father's face.

The wren
Earns his living
Noiselessly.

How much
are you enjoying yourself,
tiger moth?

A bath when you're born,
a bath when you die,
how stupid.
